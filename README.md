# Intro-Computer-Science-Honors-with-Python-SAGE
These are sample programs I use to teach intro to computer science with python (pre-req for AP CSA). 
We use http://sagecell.sagemath.org and http://trinket.io and follow texts from skylit.com, codehs.com and runestone.academy 
I have screencasts demoing this code on http://www.youtube.com/calcpage2009 
Please see my blog for more info, http://shadowfaxrant.blogspot.com 
We still have to finish Chapters 5-8 from skylit by Gary Litvin.
